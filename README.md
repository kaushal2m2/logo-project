# logo-project
This project utilizes java graphics to explore animation using java. The project creates different logos, animated and not animated and examines the efficiency of them running on a machine. Logos are meant to be light, but it seemed that animation in java was a pretty intensive process, as the initial program appeared to run very choppy and staggered. With optimizations and the use of StdDraw - a library from Princeton used to simplify the graphics in java, the project runs much better, and the animations are a lot smoother. 

It was determined that using recursion to create these animations actually seemed to make the running more efficient. Additionally, sensitivities between 1 and 10, and less than 5 layers of recursion seemed to give the best results performance wise. The 3D graphics on a 2D screen for the pyramid especially seemed to take a lot of the CPU power, as the bounds on layers of recursion especially seem to come from it. The bound for sensitivity comes from the windmill, as with high sensitivities it seems to glitch and run improperly.
