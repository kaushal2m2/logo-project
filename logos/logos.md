Logo contains a trial system with a main method that may be used to test out all of the animations/logos in the project. 
Things to note:
  -layers is passed in as an arg to main, so include it in the run of Logo.java
  -the efficiency of different sensitivities and layers may be determined with this tester
  
 The other files contain classes representing each of the logos/animations. These can be imported and used with a client to use these logos in the client project. The sensitivities and layers are made public so the client may change them for whatever their project needs. The classes are given a default start sequence to run, but the client may change the dimensions of the window and make it so the animation doesnt run infinitely.
